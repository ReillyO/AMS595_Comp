MonteCarlo.m
============

Run the script to observe the performance of the Monte Carlo pi generation algorithm as the number of sampled
points increases, as well as a demonstration of a while loop that generates a pi value of specified precision
without checking for accuracy.

====================
getMonteCarloPiVal.m
====================

Contains custom function with same name that takes a single integer input parameter and generates a value of pi
using the Monte Carlo method to the significant figure precision level of the input. Also creates a 
live-updating graph that will show random points being generated in real-time and how they fall inside the 
bounds of the circle/square.
